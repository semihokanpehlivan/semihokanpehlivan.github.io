-	Jekyll is a parse engine to serve our basic static web sites and it is also provided by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)
-	Also, we can use the markdown, liquid, html or css files with Jekyll
-	Using the Jelyll is really simple and easy to use :)
-	Before starting to use, Jekyll, we need to type some 'basic' command to terminal(we are not afraid of terminal)
-	Not: in Mac OS X, gem can be installed by default. if you don't have any idea whether gem is installed or not.
type the following command:

```
~username $ gem --version
```

-	i saw 2.0.14 is version of gem

~~~~~~
~username $ gem install jekyll
~username $ jekyll new my-web-site
~username $ cd my-web-site
~my-web-site username $ jekyll serve
~~~~~~

-	When we browse the [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000), we'll see the our main page
-	So, through $ jekyll new \<your-site-name\>, i can get the basic structure of a web-site that i can use spesific works,
it may be writing blog for simple-but-handy programming tips :)
-	I used the kramdown syntax that is based on markdown. For more detail [kramdown syntax](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html "kramdown")

*Have fun programming*
